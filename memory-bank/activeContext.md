# Active Context

## Current Session
**Goal**: Analyze project structure and update the "Memory Bank".

## Recent Changes
-   Refactoring `Education` theme (Navigation, Localization).
-   Verification of `Identity` module page analysis.
-   Established Memory Bank structure.

## Active Tasks
-   [x] Analyze Project Structure (Completed).
-   [x] Create Memory Bank Artifacts (Completed).
-   [x] Detailed Project Analysis (Completed).
    -   Verified .NET 9.0 / ABP 9.0.0 stack.
    -   Confirmed Business Modules (`Academic`, `Examination`, etc.) are currently skeletal/empty.
    -   Analyzed `Education` theme integration.

## Open Questions/Issues
-   **Implementation Priority**: Business logic modules are empty. Need to determine which module to start building first (likely `Academic` or `Examiation` based on user roadmap).
-   **Theme Refinement**: Theme structure is solid, but may need more components.
